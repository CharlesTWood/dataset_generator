# Software Created for free and open use by the public.

### The original use case for this script was to generate datasets for shop names in a database for role playing games. But it's up to your creativity and the quality of your prompt to create the outcome you are looking for.

Here's a list of blacksmith shop names generated by this script:
- The Shivering Forge
- The Fiery Forge
- The Smithy
- The Hammer and Anvil Forge
- The Shimmering Anvil
- The Anvil
- The Burning Hammer
- The Dark Forge
- The Forge
- The Ember Forge
- The Iron Anvil
- Back Alley Blacksmith
- The Olden Hammer

## Usage
Open `setup.py` and populate datasets and prompt to your needs

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Output
The script will create a new file in the datasets folder with the name you provided.
e.g `datasets/my_dataset.txt`. If the file already exists, it will append to the file.

## Setup
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<yourkey>
```
